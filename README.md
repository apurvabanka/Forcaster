# Forcaster
Using TimeSeries Forecasting To Predict Order Patterns For Restaurants

## Description

In this project we want to predict the order patterns for various restaurants using time-series forecasting. We want to explore different time-series forecasting models to understand and analyse the order patterns for specific SKUs for a particular restaurant and determine the perfect model for the use case. The models can help figure out patterns based on order volume, weather conditions, order type etc. which can then help in making better business decisions and rectifying flaws is any. Furthermore, we want to leverage recommendation system to enhance the user experience.

## Dataset

For our project, we are planning to use the "Food Delivery Dataset" available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of delivery location, order details, delivery conditions and city for a particular order. We need to filter out the required fields for specific use cases.

## Steps to achieve

- Loading the dataset directly from Kaggle and filtering the required fields based on the given data.
- Analysing different time-series models to understand the best fit.
- Making conclusions and determining patterns based on the finding from different models.
